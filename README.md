   npm install -g nodemon

   npm start

   And then find the web page on http://127.0.0.1:3000/.

2. We all worked on various aspects of the project. Corina and Matt worked to create the html for the locations in our app as well as find pictures and give each the appropriate data. Mike worked on the homepage, endpage, about, contact, faq, and contact html files and the style sheet. In the style sheet Mike added some aspects of responsive design, child manipulation, formatting and general styling..
